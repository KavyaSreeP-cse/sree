GIT REPOSITORY

git is called as repository hub where we can do projects for free

go to google->github search->download the 64 bit->then cmd->git->git config --global user.name "our filename"

conclusion: collaborate your files with repositories


week 3:
agile: iteration process(feedback from customers), investors method will be less. eg: ecommerce app, tesla
advantages(incomes are taken from customers, investing amount loss will be less, quality of project output)
waterfall in software development: without customer feedback quality check to get better output
process: user identification->splitting slices of time(prioritize the minimum work)
methodologies:1.scrum(seperated by 3 team, collaborate for work)yesterday work result->plan for today work->goal for today
3 team:owner(investment and maintain, monitoring), scrum master(scheduler),people
2. extreme programming(more outcome)
3. dynamic system and development method(uses structure for plan)

sprint(step by step process)
product backlog(product document)
intellectual property rights: tangiable(we can touch), intangiable(can't be touched)
